# TipCalculatorViews
Before creating this super simple and easy project, I exclusively used **Jetpack Compose** to create Android app UIs. I often wondered what it would be like to implement UI using an imperative approach, anticipating that it might be less enjoyable compared to Compose. However, I was pleasantly surprised. While I still have a preference for implementing interfaces using newer libraries, working with **views** turned out to be a worthwhile experience.

## About The App
There isn't much to add about the app; the name is quite self-explanatory. Users can input the total bill amount, and the app will calculate the tip based on the chosen percentage. Additionally, it provides an option to round up the result.
